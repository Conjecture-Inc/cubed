# Cubed
This is an issues-only repo for [Cubed](https://ccc.inc/), an AI software project development assistant.

Cubed links your Linear projects with your codebase on Github, and uses AI to create actionable, descriptive Linear cards.

If you have any feedback on Cubed, we'd love to hear it! 

Use :+1: :-1: emojis to help us decide which issues to prioritize.

# Getting Started

If you haven't got cubed connected to your issue management / version control software yet, head over to https://ccc.inc/ to set up the system.

# TODO

- [ ] add more marketing stuff from the website here

- [ ] add screenshots / demos from vilems figma / real screen recordings
- [ ] add social links
- [ ] add example usages?
